# email_forwarder
with cPanel you can setup your own email-forwarder

You can pass email to python script. Tested with cpanel namecheap.com.

So, with the help of this material, you can set up forwarding.

You will need to send an email to install@your.domain with "install" in the subject line. And any character in the body. You will be notified from your server what you can do after lol. Or just read my script
